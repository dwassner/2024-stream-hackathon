# Amazon Marketing Stream Hackathon 2024
This repository contains the code developed for the Amazon Marketing Stream Hackathon 2024.


## Project Overview
This project aims to showcase a practical approach to implementing the Budgets dataset.
It also highlights the ability to aggregate Placement performance across an account to observe performance trends for Top of Search, Detail Pages, and Rest of Search/Other.


## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/dwassner/2024-stream-hackathon.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Database Setup
- The repo consists sql dump files  (inside root folder `db_dump`) so that it is easier to just use them.
- To do that, you will need to have access to mysql server.
- It could be either local or in the cloud. Once you have it, create a db named `stream-hackathon`
- Import the .sql files in the newly created db.
- Update `config/rds_creds.py` accordingly


## Slack Key
- The alerts module `budget_alerts.py` expects `slack_key` as environment variable. If this is not set, the alert message will just get printed without processing Slack notifications.
- A Slack token can be generated by following the directions [here](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/getting-a-token)


## Usage
[Walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/f35a55ee8d9749799fb62afd25135bf0?sid=018a620e-f752-464d-bca2-1d9cb89d995d)

To run the application, execute:
python application.py
This will start the main application wit hthe UI.

To simulate the budget alerts script running on a scheduled basis, execute:
python budget_alerts.py
This will start the process to check for Campaigns/Placements that are beyond the budget threshold.
